## arteMetrics
Creating performance monitors for Apollo implementations of GraphQL.

## Getting Started

To get resolver metrics for your GraphQL application, follow these easy steps.

### npm

Install the arteMetrics node module into your project

```js
npm install artemetrics
```

### Installation

1. Head over to [http://artemetrics.app](http://artemetrics.app) and sign up to create a new app.

2. After signing up, create a new app by clicking on the App dropdown

3. Once you name your new app, you will be redirected to a page containing a unique API key that you can inject into your own project

4. After copying the API key to your clipboard, paste it into a .env file

```js
API_KEY = '45ed4db2-9ee5-4e30-a391-090a2c9cf0mg';
```

5. In your server file, require in our node module:

```js
const arteMetrics = require('artemetrics');
```

6. And pass in your process.env.API_KEY into arteMetrics:

```js
arteMetrics.setApiKey(process.env.API_KEY);
```

7. Then when you create an instance of ApolloServer, pass in a couple keys to the ApolloServer constructor:

```js
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  rootValue: (query) => {
    arteMetrics.getName(query);
  },
  formatResponse: (response) => {
    arteMetrics.process(response);
  }
});
```

8. And then spin up your server

```js
server.listen({ port: process.env.PORT || 4000 }).then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€ app running at ${url}`);
});
```

9. And now if you head over to [http://artemetrics.app](http://artemetrics.app) and select your app, you should be able to see the queries you made through your application and track the duration of your resolvers
